// Add ModuleEngineBurn time to all SRBs, which are defined as "any part that
// contains SolidFuel and has a ModuleEngines or ModuleEnginesFX that uses
// SolidFuel as a propellant".
//
// I've used the FINAL tag here so that it will run after all other mods
// (well, after all other mods that aren't themselves using FINAL, that is), so
// that SRBs added by mods will get the benefit of the burn time indicator, too.
